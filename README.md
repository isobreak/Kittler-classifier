This system is designed to classify tumor images obtained using dermatoscope.
The entire system is based on Kittler's algorithm which consists of many nodes.

This code represents methods of tumor segmentation and classification into "monochrome" and "multicolor" images.

The core logic consists inside "common", "classic_ML" and "CNN" folders.
Meanwhile CHECK.py files runs scripts for generating preprocessed and features datasets based on a raw dataset, training classifiers and demonstrating their work
